## Factory Method Pattern

A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.There are some advantages which we would be getting from Factory design pattern - 

- By implementing a factory design pattern we can eliminate the tight coupling from the code by removing the need to bind the application specific classes into the code.
- The factory design pattern allows sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
